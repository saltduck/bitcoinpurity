# Embedded DATUM Solo Mining

## Goal

Embed the solo-mining and Stratum V1 functionality of DATUM Gateway in
`bitcoinpurityd`, so an external SHA256d miner, including common ASICs, can mine
through the Purity node without a separate `datum_gateway` process.

DATUM Gateway commit
`dbc3b143589842feb606a409b40cd70f67117b45` is the behavioral and source
provenance baseline. Do not silently update it.

## Scope

- Vendor only the upstream-derived C sources needed for non-pooled Stratum V1,
  GBT processing, coinbase construction, share validation, and block submit.
- Keep those sources compiled as C and expose a stable C ABI to a thin Purity
  C++ lifecycle/configuration bridge.
- Keep Stage 1 communication with the node on localhost JSON-RPC using
  `getblocktemplate` and `submitblock`.
- Add `BUILD_DATUM`, default `ON`; `-DBUILD_DATUM=OFF` must remove all DATUM
  sources and DATUM-only dependency requirements.
- Add runtime `datum`, default `0`; disabled startup must not listen, create
  DATUM threads, or require DATUM runtime settings.
- Support `mining.subscribe`, `mining.authorize`, `mining.configure`, and
  `mining.submit`, plus `mining.set_difficulty` and `mining.notify`.
- Preserve extranonce, version rolling/ASICBoost, share-target, network-target,
  coinbase, Merkle, nonce, endian, and block-construction behavior from the
  baseline.
- Support Linux, macOS arm64, and Windows x64 default builds.

## Qt Settings contract

- When `BUILD_DATUM=ON`, Bitcoin-Qt must retain every upstream/master Settings
  tab and option, and add one `DATUM` tab; `BUILD_DATUM=OFF` must not show that
  tab.
- The DATUM tab exposes the runtime gate, Stratum bind/port, dedicated UPnP
  mapping, and authentication, client limits, fixed payout address, share
  difficulty, coinbase tag, and the optional loopback RPC endpoint and
  credentials.
- Saving DATUM settings writes to the read/write config file, keeps sensitive
  credentials out of `settings.json`, and marks the node for restart for all
  settings except the share-difficulty hot update. The DATUM share-difficulty
  field must update a running subsystem immediately. Existing configuration-
  file and command-line precedence remains authoritative.

## Runtime contract

When `datum=1`, support these settings:

| Setting | Default | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `datumlisten` | `127.0.0.1` | Public binding requires explicit operator action. |
| `datumport` | `23334` | Valid TCP port only. |
| `datumupnp` | `0` | Explicitly maps only the DATUM TCP port through UPnP, with PCP/NAT-PMP fallback, and requires UPnP build support plus a non-loopback IPv4 listen address. |
| `datumauth` | `0` | Missing Stratum credentials are fatal only when authentication is enabled. |
| `datumuser` | empty | Exact user or `user.worker` is accepted. |
| `datumpassword` | empty | Must match; never logged. |
| `datummaxclients` | `32` | Strict global connection bound. |
| `datummaxperip` | `4` | Strict per-IP connection bound. |
| `datumaddress` | empty | Required valid Purity payout address. |
| `datumdiff` | `65536` | Positive fixed initial/share difficulty; never changes consensus target. |
| `datumcoinbasetag` | `Bitcoin Purity` | Optional operator-controlled coinbase tag. |
| `datumrpcuser` | empty | Explicit localhost RPC credential, with safe `rpcuser` fallback. |
| `datumrpcpassword` | empty | Explicit localhost RPC credential, with safe `rpcpassword` fallback. |
| `datumrpcurl` | current network loopback RPC URL | Optional advanced override. |

The implementation must not derive the payout address from a Stratum username.
It must not reverse `rpcauth` or hard-code an RPC password.

The `setdatumdiff` RPC and the Qt DATUM share-difficulty field must hot-reload
the fixed Stratum share difficulty while DATUM is running. The value is
persisted as `datumdiff` and is runtime-only until restart, must be an integer
from 1 through 2147483647, must not alter the network consensus target, and
must cause every currently authorized miner to receive a new
`mining.set_difficulty` followed by a clean `mining.notify`. Invalid values and
calls while DATUM is stopped fail without changing the active difficulty.
Restart behavior continues to use `-datumdiff` from the normal configuration
precedence chain.

## Security acceptance criteria

- When `datumauth=1`, unauthenticated clients receive no usable mining job and
  submit is rejected before expensive share validation or template work.
- UPnP mapping is opt-in through `datumupnp=1`; it never implicitly enables
  Stratum authentication. Public deployments should enable `datumauth=1` with
  a strong unique password.
- Authentication must complete within 10 seconds by default.
- A Stratum JSON line is bounded to 16 KiB.
- Failed authentication is tracked per IP and causes disconnect/cooldown.
- Share submissions are rate-limited per client/IP without penalizing normal
  ASIC operation.
- Threads, queues, input/output buffers, clients, per-IP clients, and share
  history are bounded.
- Credentials and other secrets never appear in logs or status RPC output.
- The configured payout address is validated with Purity address decoding.

## Lifecycle acceptance criteria

- Start only after chainstate permits GBT and the RPC server has left warmup.
- Configuration errors fail node startup clearly; operational failures are
  explicit and never silently disable the subsystem.
- Purity tip updates call an in-process refresh API instead of signaling the
  process; periodic refresh remains as fallback.
- Shutdown stops accepts and clients, wakes workers, joins every DATUM thread,
  and completes before RPC/HTTP teardown.

## Verification

- Build succeeds with `BUILD_DATUM=ON` and `BUILD_DATUM=OFF`.
- Default disabled startup has no port 23334 listener and no DATUM threads.
- Configuration tests cover invalid port/difficulty/limits and missing payout,
  Stratum credentials, and RPC credentials.
- Protocol/auth tests cover subscribe, configure, correct/wrong credentials,
  worker suffixes, pre-auth submit, job gating, and share submission.
- Robustness tests cover oversized/invalid JSON, auth flooding, invalid-submit
  flooding, and disconnect mid-message.
- Integration validation covers enabled startup, external-miner job delivery,
  real hashing, accepted and rejected shares, block-candidate submit, and clean
  shutdown. A physical ASIC is not required for release acceptance; an external
  SHA256d GPU miner using the production Stratum path is sufficient.

## Non-goals

- DATUM Prime, OCEAN pooled mining, accounting, payouts, dashboard/API, Stratum
  V2, vardiff, or a public coordinator.
- Direct access to `CBlockTemplate`, `ChainstateManager`, or consensus internals.
- Changes to ASERT, difficulty adjustment, validation, chain selection,
  subsidy, P2P, mempool policy, address consensus, or any other consensus rule.
- Rewriting DATUM C as C++ or broad logger/network/mining refactors.
