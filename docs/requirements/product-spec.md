# Bitcoin Purity Product Specification

## Embedded solo mining

Bitcoin Purity includes an optional embedded DATUM Gateway Stage 1 subsystem
that serves external SHA256d miners, including common ASICs, over Stratum V1 and
uses the same node's localhost JSON-RPC `getblocktemplate` and `submitblock`
interfaces.

The compile-time feature `BUILD_DATUM` is enabled by default. Runtime activation
is disabled by default and requires the operator to set `datum=1`, a valid fixed
Purity payout address, authentication credentials, and usable localhost RPC
credentials when authentication is enabled. Authentication is disabled by
default; enabling the compiled feature must not alter consensus behavior or
ordinary node operation while runtime activation is disabled.

The subsystem preserves the mining, share-validation, version-rolling,
extranonce, coinbase, Merkle, endian, nonce, and block-submit behavior of DATUM
Gateway commit `dbc3b143589842feb606a409b40cd70f67117b45`. Upstream-derived
sources remain C and are isolated from Purity C++ by a thin C ABI bridge.

Release acceptance requires a real external SHA256d miner to hash production
Stratum jobs and submit a share through the normal block-validation path. A
physical ASIC is not required; an external GPU miner is an accepted verifier.
This acceptance policy does not remove the product requirement to remain
compatible with common SHA256 ASIC clients.

## Bitcoin-Qt Settings

The Qt Settings dialog preserves the complete upstream/master Settings surface
(including Main, Wallet, Network, Mempool, Spam filtering, Mining, and Display)
and adds a `DATUM` tab when `BUILD_DATUM=ON`. The tab configures the embedded
runtime gate, Stratum listener, dedicated DATUM UPnP mapping, authentication,
bounded client counts, fixed Purity payout address, share difficulty, coinbase
tag, and optional loopback RPC credentials. Changes are written to the
read/write config file, credentials are not written to `settings.json`, and a
restart is required for configuration changes other than the runtime share-
difficulty update. The Qt share-difficulty field uses the same runtime update
path as the `setdatumdiff` RPC when DATUM is running.

The `Window` menu also provides a read-only `DATUM` status window. It refreshes
only while visible and shows runtime and actual port-mapping state, session
share totals, estimated miner hashrate, current job/template data, connected
workers, and block-submit diagnostics. Worker names, IP addresses, and user
agents remain local to the GUI; the status RPC exposes aggregate data only.
Session counters survive miner disconnects but reset on the next DATUM run.

`datumupnp=1` is an explicit opt-in that maps only the configured DATUM TCP
port, independently of the node's P2P `upnp` setting. It uses miniupnpc when
an SSDP/IGD service is available and falls back to PCP/NAT-PMP, matching the
node's existing port-mapping behavior. It requires a build with UPnP support
and a non-loopback IPv4 DATUM listen address (or `0.0.0.0`). It does not
enable Stratum authentication;
public deployments should set `datumauth=1` and configure a strong unique
password.

While DATUM is running, the `setdatumdiff` RPC or the Qt share-difficulty field
can hot-reload only the fixed Stratum share difficulty (1 through 2147483647).
The selected value is also persisted as `datumdiff`; existing authorized miners
receive a clean `mining.set_difficulty` and `mining.notify`; the network
consensus target is unchanged. A restart loads the persisted `-datumdiff` value.

The public protocol, configuration defaults, security controls, lifecycle,
verification criteria, and non-goals are normative in
[`input/requirements.md`](../../input/requirements.md).
